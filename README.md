# Awesome-Anomaly-Detection-Baseline

[TOC]

## Background

The repo reproduced baselines of the anomaly detection algorithm on the attribute graph.

## Example Datasets

*•* **BlogCatalog**: BlogCatalog is a blog sharing website. The bloggers in blogcatalog can follow each other forming a social network. Users are associated with a list of tags to describe themselves and their blogs, which are regarded as node attributes.

*•* **Flickr**: Flickr is an image hosting and sharing website. Similar to BlogCatalog, users can follow each other and form a social network. Node attributes of users are defined by their specified tags that reflect their interests.

*•* **ACM**: ACM is another attributed network from academic field. It is a citation network where each paper is regarded as a node on the network, and the links are the citation relations among different papers. The attributes of each paper are generated from the paper abstract.
